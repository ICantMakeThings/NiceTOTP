## But Why?? 

There are a few reasons why I made this device, mainly to lose dependence of my phone. But not just, What if your phone breaks, bricks, or something else? I rather have lots of devices that don't depend on eachother rather than a all in one for that reason, plus most "universal" stuff performs worse than a specific device for that single function. As of right now, I'd say it's almost complete (enough to daily drive), possibly a few more hardware security features, maybe UI polishing, fixing any bugs i haven't found yet and should be perfect. The cost is ~Â£6 excluding 3D printing.
