## But Why?? 

There are a few reasons why I made this device, mainly to lose dependence of my phone. But not just, What if your phone breaks, bricks, or something else? I rather have lots of devices that don't depend on eachother rather than a all in one for that reason, plus most "universal" stuff performs worse than a specific device for that single function. As of right now, I'd say it's almost complete (enough to daily drive), possibly a few more hardware security features, maybe UI polishing, fixing any bugs i haven't found yet and should be perfect. The cost is ~Â£6 excluding 3D printing.

# More Info / 1 Month Review
Using it for one month, The battery has been used up ~20% (750mAh supposedly)
2 month update, it still only has been used up 20%.. so ye

The RTC drifted a whoping 8 seconds in that month, I mean what?!

It still shows the right code tho, but that means the last 8 Seconds are invalid. I will need to see whats up with the RTC

Or Find a better one.
